# hellokrushi_final_javafx



## Getting started

Hello Krushi is a java application designed to bridge the gap between farmers and laborers, enabling farmers to find and hire laborers for various agricultural tasks and providing laborers with job opportunities. The app also offers additional features to support the agricultural community, such as buying and selling animals, renting farming implements, and providing agricultural news.

## Add your files

```
To get started with Hello Krushi, you can clone the repository and set up the project locally:
cd existing_repo
git remote add origin https://github.com/tushargaikwadgit/javafx_project.git
git branch -M main
git push -uf origin main

```

## Integrate with your tools

Set up project integrations by connecting with Firebase for database management and java for backend services.

## Collaborate with your team

You can invite team members, create new merge requests, and enable auto-merge for continuous integration and deployment.

## Test and Deploy

Use the built-in continuous integration in Github.

# Editing this README

When you're ready to make this README your own, just edit this file and use the handy template below (or feel free to structure it however you want - this is just a starting point!). Thanks to [makeareadme.com](https://www.makeareadme.com/) for this template.

## Suggestions for a good README

Every project is different, so consider which of these sections apply to yours. The sections used in the template are suggestions for most open source projects. Also keep in mind that while a README can be too long and detailed, too long is better than too short. If you think your README is too long, consider utilizing another form of documentation rather than cutting out information.

## Name
Hello krushi

## Description
Hello Krushi is designed to connect farmers and laborers, offering features such as job matching, a marketplace for buying and selling animals, and renting farming implements. The app is also equipped with a news section to keep users informed about the latest agricultural developments.

## Badges
On some READMEs, you may see small images that convey metadata, such as whether or not all the tests are passing for the project. You can use Shields to add some to your README. Many services also have instructions for adding a badge.

## Visuals
Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method.

## Installation
Prerequisites
~ Java and JavaFX for frontend development.
~ Java for backend services.
~ Firebase for database management.

## Usage
Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.

## Support
Tell people where they can go to for help. It can be any combination of an issue tracker, a chat room, an email address, etc.

## Roadmap
Future releases may include:

~ Enhanced user interface with additional customization options.
~ Expanded marketplace with more categories.
~ Integration with additional payment gateways.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! Please fork the repository, create a new branch, and submit a pull request. Ensure that your code adheres to the existing style and passes all tests before submitting.
